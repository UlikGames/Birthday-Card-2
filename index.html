But you know, I'm very lucky at this matters :(. His coming is only a bad timing. I did mistakes. I know. But I regret so much. But it's one of the things I learned from games. Nobody deliberately does it wrong. He is probably on an unlucky day. Or he had unlucky things. You are the person I give the most value in my life. Because you are the only person who understands me. And I don't want to lost YOU or other valuables. You know, I love you too much. But people do mistakes against their loved ones. Whatever just **** it. Sorry for ruin your birthday with this message. Enjoy your day. And Don't fotget to<strong>Smile</strong> a lot ^^. And say "Hello" to  Nika from me :). Maybe I'm not there. But you know I'm <strong>"THERE"</strong>. Again and Again <strong>sorry</strong> for everything and <strong>thanks</strong> for everything. Again a VERY VERY Happy Birthday!</p>
